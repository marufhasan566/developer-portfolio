            <p>
                To become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s also
                recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills
                will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.
